# Microsoft Outlook Phishlet: Leveraging Evilginx for Phishing Simulations

The **Microsoft Outlook phishlet** for **Evilginx** is an essential tool for anyone involved in penetration testing, red teaming, or phishing simulation exercises. Evilginx is a powerful man-in-the-middle framework designed to bypass multi-factor authentication (MFA) and capture session tokens for login bypass attacks.

## What is Evilginx?

[Evilginx](https://evilginx.net) is an advanced phishing framework that intercepts a user’s authentication process with legitimate sites. Unlike traditional phishing methods that aim to steal passwords, Evilginx captures session cookies, allowing attackers to bypass MFA and access the victim’s account directly. This approach makes Evilginx highly effective for phishing attempts on platforms like Microsoft Outlook, which often have robust security measures in place.

## Why Use Microsoft Outlook Phishlet?

The **Microsoft Outlook phishlet** is invaluable for security teams and researchers looking to simulate real-world phishing attacks. Given the widespread use of Outlook for corporate email, it’s a prime target for attackers. By simulating phishing attacks with this phishlet, organizations can identify vulnerabilities and strengthen their defenses against credential theft and MFA bypass.

## Setting Up Evilginx with Microsoft Outlook Phishlet

To deploy the **Microsoft Outlook phishlet**, you first need to install [Evilginx](https://evilginx.net) on your server. Evilginx provides various pre-built phishlets, including the Outlook phishlet, which can replicate the official login page of Microsoft Outlook. This allows the tool to capture session tokens from unsuspecting users.
